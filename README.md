# Simulating a charging station for Electric Vehicles (EV) based on the concept of the Markov chain to analyze the system performance
 
Since environmental challenges have diminished due to global modernization, technology is crucial in addressing pertinent problems by lowering pollution in many regions. One of the most crucial topics is intelligent transportation, which may be evaluated by substituting the Electric Vehicle (EV) with fossil fuel, which has increased megacity pollution in recent years. This research intends to model the EV and charging station in the car- sharing scenario using the Markov chain approach to determine the most accurate simulation runs and timing parameters. In addition, by separating the region into commercial and residential zones, we attempted to determine the behavior of consumers in standby and charge queue length. The findings demonstrate the simulationâ€™s effectiveness since they are an exact reflection of actual conduct.
